                Pakistan,[e] officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,[f] is a country in South Asia. It is the
                fifth-most populous country, with a population of over 241.5 million,[g] having the second-largest
                Muslim population as of 2023. Islamabad is the nation's capital, while Karachi is its largest city and
                financial centre. Pakistan is the 33rd-largest country by area and the ninth-largest in Asia. Bounded by
                the Arabian Sea on the south, the Gulf of Oman on the southwest, and the Sir Creek on the southeast, it
                shares land borders with India to the east; Afghanistan to the west; Iran to the southwest; and China to
                the northeast. It shares a maritime border with Oman in the Gulf of Oman, and is separated from
                Tajikistan in the northwest by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor.

            <p class="sectionSubTag ">The Transforming Education in Pakistan (TEP) programme managed a political
                advocacy and media campaign in Pakistan to ensure that parents and communities demand good-quality
                education and that the government takes tangible steps to provide free quality education to all children
                between the ages of 5 and 16. The campaign, Alif Ailaan, worked through six core strandsâ€”political and
                government, media, research, digital/social media, civil society and alliances.

                Alif Ailaan embedded specific education issues into the discourse, set a precedent of data-informed
                journalism and reporting on education, pioneered a series of ground-breaking publications, and
                successfully lobbied for the government to research, calculate, and publish a nationally accepted number
                for out-of-school children between the ages of 5 and 16.SS  .
